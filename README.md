This repository contains all the GATE/Matlab/Python routines needed to replicate the results of the paper Low-dose X-ray Compton Backscattering Imaging via Structured Light

# Abstract

Compton Back-scattering imaging (CBI) is a technique that uses ionizing radiation to determine the presence of low atomic number materials on a given target. Unlike transmission X-ray imaging, the source and sensor are located on the same side, such that the photons of interest are scattered back after the radiation impinges on the body. Rather than scanning the target pixel by pixel with a pencil beam, this paper proposes the use of cone beam coded illumination to create a Compressive X-rays Compton  Back-scattering Imager (CXBI). The concept  was developed and tested using Montecarlo Simulations through the Geant4 Application for Tomography Emissions (GATE), with conditions close to the ones encountered on experiments, and posteriorly, a test-bed implementation was mounted in the laboratory. The CXBI was evaluated under several conditions and with different materials as target. 
Reconstructions  were run using denoising-prior based inverse problem algorithms. Finally, a preliminary dose analysis is done to evaluate the viability of CXBI for human scanning.
